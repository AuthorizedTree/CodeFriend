# CodeFriend
This project was done with the purpose of learning how to utilize an AI's API.

"npm create vite@latest client --template vanilla" was ran in the root directory to create a vanilla javascript
repository.

Make sure to run "npm install" in the ./client directory so that you will get the relevant node module packages needed for this project. 

Make sure to run "npm init -y" in the ./server directory to generate a package.json file inside. 
Afterwards run "npm install cors dotenv express nodemon openai" for cross origin requests, secure environment variables, backend framework, application running when implementing changes, and the AI that is being used for the API.
